// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// * authentication/tokens-scoping.adoc
filtered by namespace.

* `role:<cluster-role name>:<namespace or * for all>` - Limits the scope to the
rules specified by the cluster-role, but only in the specified namespace .
+
[NOTE]
====
Caveat: This prevents escalating access. Even if the role allows access to
resources like secrets, rolebindings, and roles, this scope will deny access
to those resources. This helps prevent unexpected escalations. Many people do
not think of a role like `edit` as being an escalating role, but with access to
a secret it is.
====

* `role:<cluster-role name>:<namespace or * for all>:!` -  This is similar to the
example above, except that including the bang causes this scope to allow
escalating access.
